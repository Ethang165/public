  description
    "This module adds configuration and operational state relating to
    policies for traffic destined to the system's control-plane.
    Particularly, it allows for mechanisms to:
     - apply an ACL that forwards or drops traffic towards the control-plane.
     - classify traffic that is destined to the control-plane according to
       a QoS classifier.
     - schedule traffic that has been forwarded towards the control-plane,
       to allow for policies such as rate limits to be applied.
    The configured policies apply generically to all control-planes that
    exist within the system, and should be mapped to the internal interfaces
    via which packets are forwarded to control-plane modules.
    When a packet is received at an input interface - it is classified into a
    forwarding group which drains to a specific queue. If this input mapping
    is sufficient, the CPU-facing interface uses the specified scheduler
    to determine how to drain queues. If more granular remapping is required
    (e.g., to classify control-plane traffic more granularly), a user specifies
    an alternate classifier that is used to reclassify traffic into
    a new set of forwarding-groups (and hence queues) that can subsequently
    be scheduled by the specified scheduler.
    The specified control-plane ACL is applied to traffic received by the
    control-plane of the system.";
